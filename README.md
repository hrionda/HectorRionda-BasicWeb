### HectorRionda-BasicWeb
This is a basic project that uses HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL (and a tiny bit of JS) to create a barebones full-stack web application.
This project has been adapted from a school project which was made over the course of a semester.
The website is divided into 4 main "programs" or segments. The programs become increasingly more complicated as it goes up from Program 1 to 4

## Programs/Segments
- Program 1: This program utilized HTML front-end tools to display information about cats.
- Program 2: This program intorduced a PHP controller to extract information from a form and present it back to the user.
- Program 3: This program utilized a MySQL back-end to store information entered into the form. This program can also sends emails with Contact Me.
- Program 4: This program uses JavaScript to show a working clock and introduces placeholders and pop-up windows.

# DISCLAIMER
Some parts of this project contain images or embedded links to YouTube videos or other websites.
I do not claim to own ANY of these images or websites, and all appropriate credit for these media go to their respective creators.

# NOTES
This website is not meant for production use due to it not being secure enough to be hosted on a server.
For example, this code does not properly sanitize user input, leaving it vulnerable to SQL injections.
Also, some arguments contained in the code which contained sensitive information from my university have also been omitted.
However, the general structure (or "skeleton") of the code has been preserved in these instances.
